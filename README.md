# Hey there dotNet!
***

Before I wanted to make my final decision on how I will continue my coding web dev journey, I'm going to dive in this .NET world.
I've heard and seen things about it in the past, present. But never really looked into it.

So this is what I'm going to do, learn more about .NET and see if it will fit me or not.

We got some exercises through BeCode, but I will try to mix and match. So I will be following the official documentation and the learning .NET provides.
